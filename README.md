Ecommercely - an Ecommerce Website (Full Stack Project)

Developed e-commerce, it displays all the products related to the category selected and after you select the individual project you will get all the information related to the selected, the color, size, availability, and price. You can add to the cart that product and then you can place an order. All the orders are displayed in the order section. The website has a login and signup page after login only the user can add products to the cart. It has functionality that once the order is placed it automatically reduces the stock from the database.

(test and share your feedback to me it will be super useful)

Tech Used: Nextjs, MongoDB (Database), JWT, CryptoJs (For Login/Signup), and Vercel (for hosting)

Used MongoDB atlas for the website being hosted on Vercel to test the website.

Also going to make an admin panel (in progress) it will help the owner to add products and can have a good track of products, stock, orders, and revenue.
